In this project, I used my knowledge of asynchronous functions and APIs to create a weather app.

The app fetches the weather using a Visual Crossings weather API with the location the user inputs. Users can input an address, U.S. zip code, or coordinates as a location.

An invalid location will trigger a popup advising the user to enter a valid location.

The app displays the current temperature (which the user can switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius), precipitation, humidity, and wind speeds (in mph or km/h based on if the user is using Fahrenheit or Celsius). 

The app also displays the day and time and a short description of current weather conditions. Any weather alerts are also displayed and can be clicked to reveal a popup with more information.

The app also displays the hourly temp, precipitation, and windspeeds. 

Finally, the app displays the weekly weather with min/max temperatures, and clicking on a day of the week will display that day's weather conditions as well.
